# Neuro240

get_dataset.ipynb was used for formatting VinBigData dataset

get_images.ipynb was used for formatting CheXpert

model_training.ipynb is the new notebook for training the models (the old one was trained on the wrong subset of classes)

gradcam.ipynb extracts and applies an overlay for explainability purposes on the images

My .pth model weights are too large to be uploaded to github.
